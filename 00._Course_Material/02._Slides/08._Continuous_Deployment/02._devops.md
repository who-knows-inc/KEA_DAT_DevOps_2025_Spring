# Information silos vs. knowledge silos

* **Information silos**: Departments are isolated from each other and do not share data or information. 

* **Knowledge silos**: Expertise is isolated and isn't shared across teams or individuals. 

The number one reflection during the exams is that the group was hindered by not sufficiently sharing knowledge. Tackle this problem now.

*What are ways you could break down knowledge silos in you group?*

# Meta-slide: This course actually contains two ongoing tracks at once

1. The Technical track: The things you need to implement and the technical challenges that you face.

2. The DevOps track: Applying DevOps principles 

It's easy to give you assignments for the first track. It's impossible to write assignments for how you should think and behave. But to ace the course, it's insufficient to only excel in the first track. 

Your task is to see the technical challenges as a way to practice the DevOps principles. Even without explicit assignments, you must constantly consider how to apply the theory presented in this course.

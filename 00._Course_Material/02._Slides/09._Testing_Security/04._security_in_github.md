# What is the problem with these Github Action snippets?

I see students come to the exam with this:

```yaml
 steps:
      - name: SSH into the server
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1.2.0
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
          key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          script: |
            whoami
            uname -a
```

```yaml
   steps:
      - name: Upload file to remote server
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1.2.0
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
          key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}
          script: |
            scp /path/to/local/file ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}@${{ secrets.HOST }}:/path/to/remote/destination
```

# Don't blindly use third part Github marketplace actions

Especially when it comes to handing over credentials. 

*How would you create a `ssh` and `scp` step without the above?*

---

# It's actually much simpler!

You already learned how to use `ssh` and `scp` from the command line. No need to use a third-party extension:

```yaml
  deploy:
    name: Deploy using SSH and SCP
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Copy file to remote server using SCP
        run: |
          scp -i ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }} /path/to/local/file ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}@${{ secrets.HOST }}:/path/to/remote/destination

      - name: Execute commands on remote server using SSH
        run: |
          ssh -i ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }} ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}@${{ secrets.HOST }} << 'EOF'
            echo "I am on the server now"
          EOF
```

# Hash-pinning

Related to the above. What if you want to use a third-party action? How do you avoid that they don't add malicious code in the future?

https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions

*Why does the documentation recommend hash-pinning rather than using a specific version?*
